Project Pitch
At GrooveBox we give you the ingredients you need to build vibey grooves and ride tasty waves. At it's simplest, GrooveBox is a 
single page react-based website that loads a step-sequencer drum machine that allows you to build a beat. when you have a beat 
you're into, you can toggle over to the canvas visualizer, which also happens to feature a hidden playable keyboard.
